# Adventure!

Now you've put the golden square together to build a multi-class system using
pairing, debugging, test-driven development and object-oriented design.

You can take a number of paths through the material below. In each you will
learn different things. Choose based on which most appeals to you, and with the
trust that there is nothing here that you can't learn later if you need to.
